Code Explanation:
	Random package is imported in the code due to which we can generate different numbers in the code.(line 1)
	A list is initialized by using string objects and the name of the colours are initialized to the list.(line 2)
	It displays a welcome message to the user.(line 3)
	i objects is initialized to 0.(line 4)
	while loop starts using the condition i should be equal to zero.(line 5)
	Object g is initialized randomly by the r.randint(0,7) throughout the program where the value of g is randomly changed if the while loop executes.(line 6)
	The value of g object is given to the list.The list returns a string object and is initialized to s object.(line 7)
	The program then asks for an input,the user enters the colour.(line 8)
	if condition checks whether the guessed colour is right or wrong.(line 9)
		displays the message is right.(line 10)
	else condition (line 11)
		displays the message if its wrong.(line 12)
